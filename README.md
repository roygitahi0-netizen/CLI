Known Issues
Duplicate projects — Running add-project twice with the same title creates duplicates since there is no uniqueness check
Task lookup by title — add-task and complete-task search by project/task title, so tasks or projects with the same name across different users can cause conflicts
No task update — There is no command to edit or delete a task once it has been added
No user deletion — Users cannot be removed via the CLI; you would need to manually edit data/database.json
Extra spaces in titles — Titles with accidental extra spaces are saved as-is and must be matched exactly in subsequent commands
